To run kinoFMT to solve the quadrotor planning problem from an initial state to a goal region, you must first have the necessary precomputed files.

Run init.py with the desired n and Jth. This takes a while.
Run fmt_quad, making sure to set the values of n and Jth towards the bottom of the file (under:      if __name__ == "__main__":)
